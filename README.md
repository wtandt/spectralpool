Spectral Pool is an audio visual multitouch polyphonic sound recording studio right in your web browser. It allows you to visualise and interpret all things sound. You can use your microphone, sound card stereomix,usb guitar, midi keyboard, to build and record your own tracks by yourself of with your friends. You can see what you play and interact by using a spectral analysis and a multitouch polyphonic theremin. The theremin and spectral analysis can be controlled via paramaeters, allowing them to aligned or offset, this allows you to paint a canvas of sound in real time. Using the tuna effects in the controller you can mix the color and shape of the sound you are creating.
